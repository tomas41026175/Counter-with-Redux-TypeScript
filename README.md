# Counter with Redux & TypeScript
 This project is a counter application built using Redux and TypeScript. The goal is to demonstrate how to combine the powerful type system of TypeScript with the state management capabilities of Redux to create a robust and maintainable application.

## Features
**Counter Management**: Leverages Redux for state management, ensuring consistency and easy tracking across the application.
**Dynamically Add Counters**: Users can dynamically add counters, each operating independently.
**State Persistence**: Uses Redux to ensure state persistence, guaranteeing that user state remains unchanged with each reload of the application.
## Getting Started
**Installation:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install all project dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```
**Running the Application:** Start the development server and run the app with:
```
npm start
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application in action.
